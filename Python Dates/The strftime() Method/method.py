#The datetime object has a method for formatting date objects into readable strings.

#The method is called strftime(), and takes one parameter, format, to specify the format of the returned string:

#Display the name of the month:

import datetime

x = datetime.datetime(2018, 6, 1)

print(x.strftime("%B"))
