#If you need to create a global variable, but are stuck in the local scope, you can use the global keyword.

#The global keyword makes the variable global.

#If you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope:

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = 300

myfunc()

print(x)

#Also, use the global keyword if you want to make a change to a global variable inside a function.

#To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword:

x = 300

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = 200

myfunc()

print(x)
