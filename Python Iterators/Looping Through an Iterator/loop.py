#We can also use a for loop to iterate through an iterable object:
#Iterate the values of a tuple:

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

for x in mytuple:
  print(x)


#Iterate the characters of a string:

mystr = "banana"

for x in mystr:
  print(x)
#The for loop actually creates an iterator object and executes the next() method for each loop.
