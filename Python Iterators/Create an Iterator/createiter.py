#To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() 
#to your object.

#As you have learned in the Python Classes/Objects chapter, all classes have a function called __init__(), 
#which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created.

#The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), 
#but must always return the iterator object itself.

#The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.

#Create an iterator that returns numbers, starting with 1, and each sequence will increase by one (returning 1,2,3,4,5 etc.):

class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    x = self.a
    self.a += 1
    return x

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
